# The 2-Hour Analyst OS™

**An Excel-Based Analyst Operating System for Executive-Ready Reporting**

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **2-Hour Analyst OS™** is an Excel-based operating system for analysts who produce recurring reports and need **speed, reliability, and executive trust**.

It replaces fragile, ad-hoc spreadsheets with a **repeatable system** that separates inputs, logic, dashboards, and outputs.

This repository explains the **architecture, principles, and thinking** behind the Analyst OS™ — not the full commercial asset.

> ⚠️ This repo is intentionally limited. It documents *how the system works*, not the paid implementation.

## 🧠 The Core Idea

Most analysts don’t have a skill problem.

They have a **system problem**.

They rebuild the same reports every week or month, fix broken formulas, clean messy exports, and rush dashboards before meetings.

The 2-Hour Analyst OS™ replaces ad-hoc spreadsheets with a **repeatable operating system**.

---

## 🧩 System Architecture

The Analyst OS™ follows a strict, corporate-grade architecture:

```
RAW DATA
   ↓
POWER QUERY (Cleaning & Automation)
   ↓
LOGIC ENGINE (Business Rules & Calculations)
   ↓
DASHBOARD (Executive KPIs)
   ↓
EXPORT (PowerPoint / Email / Stakeholder Outputs)
```

Each layer is isolated, governed, and purpose-built.

## 📁 Folder & Sheet Philosophy

Inside the full system, sheets are named and ordered deliberately:

* `00_README` – Control center & governance rules
* `01_RAW_DATA` – Safe input layer (audit-friendly)
* `02_POWER_QUERY` – One-click data cleaning
* `03_LOGIC_ENGINE` – Central business logic
* `04_DASHBOARD` – Executive-ready insights
* `05_EXPORT` – Presentation-ready outputs

This prevents:

* Broken formulas
* Accidental overwrites
* Analyst panic before meetings

---

## 🧮 Logic-First, Not Feature-First

Most Excel tutorials teach features.

The Analyst OS™ teaches **logic**:

* How to encode business rules
* How to separate calculation from presentation
* How to make spreadsheets resilient to change

The result: reports that **don’t break** when data changes.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Design Principles

Dashboards in the Analyst OS™ are:

* KPI-driven (not chart-heavy)
* Executive-readable in under 30 seconds
* Filterable without breaking logic
* Built for decision-making, not decoration

---
